This point tracker was developed to support the work of the University of Michigan’s Society of Women Engineers (SWE). 
Users can update an input file with current member uniquenames, while the program accepts a list of participant uniquenames 
through terminal input. This tool is designed to streamline point tracking and reduce administrative workload for current 
and future SWE board members, and it can be easily adapted for use by other student organizations!

Please feel free to contact me at guona@umich.edu if you have any suggestions for improving this code!
